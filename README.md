# KanjiStrokesAnalysis

## Analyzing the Most Frequent Stroke Counts in Kanji.

## :cinema: Video:
* https://youtu.be/wuXPPO2vNgU

## :grey_question: What is it?
* I was interested in what the average complexity of a Kanji, defined by the number of strokes used.
* I have not been able to find any data on this, so I decided to to it myself!
* The results may help visualize how languages balance the number of possible permutations on their characters with the limits of human memory.
* I also wanted to learn some more pandas / matplotlib for data analysis. Was fun!

## :zap: Features:
* Analysis of Kanji stroke patterns by overall word frequency!
* Weighs each Kanji by their average use in natural language, then finds the most common stroke counts used in every-day language!
* Graphs! (Bar and Pie right now).
* Finds standard deviation and mean of most common stroke counts!

###### :hammer: To do:
* Play around more with plot-fitting. See if you can try to find the mean / std of the plot that was fitted in the video!
